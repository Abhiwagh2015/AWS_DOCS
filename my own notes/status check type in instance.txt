The status check of an EC2 instance in AWS is reported in the format of "status check type X/Y", where X indicates the number of checks that have failed and Y indicates
 the total number of checks performed. The checks are performed by AWS automatically at regular intervals to ensure that the instance is healthy and functioning properly.

The two types of status checks that AWS performs are the Instance Status Check and the System Status Check. The Instance Status Check monitors the instance at the system level,
 while the System Status Check monitors the underlying infrastructure and hardware.

Here's what each possible status check type means:

"status check type 0/2" - This means that the instance has failed both the Instance Status Check and the System Status Check. 
                          This indicates that there is a problem with the instance or the underlying infrastructure, and corrective action is needed.

"status check type 1/2" - This means that the instance has failed one of the two status checks. It is important to investigate the issue and take corrective action.

"status check type 2/2" - This means that the instance has passed both the Instance Status Check and the System Status Check, indicating that the instance is healthy and functioning properly.

"status check type 0/1" - This means that the Instance Status Check has passed, but the System Status Check has failed. This may be due to issues with the 
                          underlying infrastructure, and corrective action may be needed.

"status check type 1/0" - This means that the Instance Status Check has failed, but the System Status Check has passed. 
                          This may indicate a problem with the instance itself, such as an issue with the operating system or applications running on it.
