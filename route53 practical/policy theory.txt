Failover policy
Let's say you have two instances, A and B, serving the same application. You want instance A to be the active (primary) server, and instance B to be the passive (backup)
server. If instance A becomes unavailable, traffic should automatically failover to instance B.

Geolocation routing policy
Scenario: Multi-Region Application
Let's consider a scenario where you have a multi-region application with servers located in different regions (Region A and Region B). You want to route traffic to the
nearest server based on the geographic location of the users.
********************************************

GeoProximity routing policy
Certainly! GeoProximity routing is used to route traffic based on the physical proximity of the requesting clients to your AWS resources. This is particularly useful when 
you have resources in multiple AWS regions, and you want to direct traffic to the closest or most optimal location. Additionally, GeoProximity routing allows for shifting 
traffic in case of resource failures or maintenance. Here's a scenario where you might use GeoProximity routing:

Scenario: Global Content Delivery Network (CDN)
Let's imagine you have a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) with caching servers in multiple AWS regions. Your goal is to route user requests to the closest caching 
server to improve latency and reduce the load on your infrastructure. You're using GeoProximity routing in Amazon Route 53.
********************************************

Latency routing policy 
Certainly! Latency-based routing is employed when you have resources in multiple AWS regions, and you want to direct traffic to the region that offers the best latency 
for the end-users. Here's a scenario where you might use latency-based routing in a private hosted zone with Amazon Route 53:

Scenario: Global Web Application with Multiple Regions
Imagine you have a web application that is hosted in multiple AWS regions (e.g., US East, Europe, and Asia). Your goal is to provide users with the best possible experience 
by directing their traffic to the AWS region with the lowest latency. You are using Amazon Route 53 to manage DNS and leverage latency-based routing.
**********************************************

IP-based routing policy
While Amazon Route 53 doesn't provide a specific routing policy named "IP-based routing," you can achieve similar functionality by leveraging the GeoIP-based routing 
feature available in AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) along with Amazon CloudFront. Here's a scenario where you might want to control access to a web application based 
on the IP addresses of the users:

Scenario: Restricting Access to a Web Application Based on User Location
Let's say you have a web application and you want to restrict access based on the geographical location of the users. You can use AWS WAF with CloudFront in conjunction 
with Amazon Route 53 for DNS resolution.
************************************************

Multivalue answer routing policy
Certainly! The multivalue answer routing policy in Amazon Route 53 allows you to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random. This can be 
useful for scenarios where you have multiple resources that can handle a particular DNS query, and you want to distribute the traffic among those resources randomly. 
Here's a hypothetical scenario where you might use the multivalue answer routing policy in a private hosted zone:

Scenario: Load Balancing Across Multiple Data Centers
Imagine you have a private infrastructure with multiple data centers, each hosting a set of identical resources (e.g., web servers). You want to distribute DNS queries 
across these data centers randomly to achieve load balancing and improve overall resource utilization.
************************************************

Weighted routing policy
Certainly! The weighted routing policy in Amazon Route 53 allows you to route traffic to multiple resources based on proportions that you specify. This is useful when 
you want to distribute traffic unevenly among different resources based on their capacity or other considerations. Here's a scenario where you might use the weighted 
routing policy in a private hosted zone:

Scenario: Traffic Distribution Across Different Versions of an Application
Imagine you have two versions of a web application, and you want to gradually roll out the new version while keeping some traffic on the old version. You have resources 
in your private infrastructure serving both versions, and you want to control the traffic distribution.
