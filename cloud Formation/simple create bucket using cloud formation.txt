AWS CloudFormation Features
    AWS CloudFormation gives you an easy way to model a collection of related AWS and third-party resources, provision them quickly and consistently, and manage them 
    throughout their lifecycles, by treating infrastructure as code. A CloudFormation template describes your desired resources and their dependencies so you can launch 
    and configure them together as a stack. You can use a template to create, update, and delete an entire stack as a single unit, as often as you need to, instead of 
    managing resources individually. You can manage and provision stacks across multiple AWS accounts and AWS Regions.


Cross account & cross-region management
      CloudFormation StackSets let you provision a common set of AWS resources across multiple accounts and regions, with a single CloudFormation template. StackSets 
      takes care of automatically and safely provisioning, updating, or deleting stacks, no matter where they are.

Authoring with JSON/YAML
      CloudFormation allows you to model your entire cloud environment in text files. You can use open-source declarative languages, such as JSON or YAML, to describe 
      what AWS resources you want to create and configure. If you prefer to design visually, you can use AWS CloudFormation Designer to help you get started with AWS 
      CloudFormation templates.

Build serverless applications with SAM
      Build serverless applications faster with the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), an open-source framework that provides shorthand syntax to express functions, 
      APIs, databases, and event source mappings. With just a few lines per resource, you can define the application you want and model it using YAML. During deployment, 
      SAM transforms and expands the SAM syntax into CloudFormation syntax. 

Practical:-

Goal:- This is Region specific service, suppose you are in use cloud formation specific region (Mumbai) now, create bucket using cloud formation with json/yml code format 
       through create bucket in Mumbai region..

step 1 :-

Goto Google search "aws cloud formation template for s3"
            click on "s3:bucket aws cloud formation" and copy following code


     create simple textfile with the extention Ex. bucket.json and paste following code and type uniqu bucket name
{
    "Resources": {
        "S3Bucket": {
            "Type": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
            "DeletionPolicy": "Retain",
            "Properties": {
                "BucketName": "sagarbucket1212121"
            }
        }
    }
}

Ex.bucket name is "sagar-bucket-april-2023"
       
step 2:-
     GoTo "Cloud Formation" Service
                              #Create a CloudFormation stack
                              #Use your own template or a sample template to quickly get started.
     click "Create Stack"
     Click "Template is Ready"
     click "Upload a template file"
           Choose File "bucket.json"
     type stack name "mystack"     

click "next"

     permision "No change"

click "Next"


step 3:-
     Goto return stack "mystack"
            show status "create complate"
             Click on stack 
                 show stack _info
                 show events "create bucket" and succesfully/failed stack
