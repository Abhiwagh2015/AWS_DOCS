1.create two instances in one availabillity zone
     1.web-server 
     2.ebs-demo

2.create new volume
     name : new-volume, 5GB storage, General purpose GP2

3. connect web-server instance
      lsblk    #show block of storage with xvda block but not show xvdf block
      df -h    #show size of block
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 4.Goto volume
    click on volume goto actions and attach then select instance web-server
    device name automatically show /dev/sdf but you have to change

5.Goto instance web-server
    lsblk   #show xvdf
    df -h   #not show xvdf storage because of not available file system
    file -s /dev/xvdf      #show filesystem have or not
    /dev/xvdf: data    #suppose this massage is show no filesystem available
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf    #this command through take a filesystem
    file -s /dev/xvdf  
        /dev/xvdf: Linux rev 1.0 ext4 filesystem data, UUID=94937119-1f50-40a2-80aa-4cff2d34a7c8 (extents) (64bit) (large files) (huge files)   #mean filesystem available
          
    lsblk
    df -h    #no mount block but add filesystem
    mkdir /data
    mount /dev/xvdf  /data
    df -h
    resize2fs /dev/xvdf    #following massage is show
       resize2fs 1.46.5 (30-Dec-2021)
       The filesystem is already 1310720 (4k) blocks long.  Nothing to do!

******************************************
Extend root volume Ex. web-server instance  (This is for suppose ext4 as a filesystem )

1. Goto volume 
    select web-server volume click actions modify volume extend 5 to 10GB and save

2. Goto web-server Instance & follow commands
   lsblk    #show extend volume 
   df -h    #but filesystem storage does not increase why follow command
   growpart /dev/xvda 1
      CHANGED: partition=1 start=227328 old: size=16549855 end=16777183 new: size=20744159 end=20971487
   lsblk
   df -h                    #again not change filesystem mount storage
   resize2fs /dev/xvda1     #after that this command through change filesystem storage
             resize2fs 1.46.5 (30-Dec-2021)
             Filesystem at /dev/xvda1 is mounted on /; on-line resizing required
             old_desc_blocks = 1, new_desc_blocks = 2
             The filesystem on /dev/xvda1 is now 2593019 (4k) blocks long. 
    df -h   #show extend storage

*********************************************
Extend root volume Ex. web-server instance  (This is for suppose xfs as a filesystem )

1. file -s /dev/xvda1
   xfs_growfs /dev/xvda1
   df -h
