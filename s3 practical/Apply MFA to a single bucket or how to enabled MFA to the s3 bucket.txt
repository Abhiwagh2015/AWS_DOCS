Apply MFA to a single bucket or how to enabled MFA to the s3 bucket ?

Ans:- steps first activate the MFA to the root user go to IAM MFA activate then 
Go to the s3 service ---- go to the bucket click on bucket and see the properties MFA is disabled 
Go to the CLI aws --- to the command prompt 
	aws configure
aws s3api list-buckets -- this is command 
	aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket resident-evil1 --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled --mfa "arn:aws:iam::065068297386:mfa/root-account-mfa-device 859871"
				****note
this is enable MFA command****** resident-evil1 is my bucket name 065068297386 this is my root id 
	then you try to bucket delete or not if you delete then show versioning then now to try delete then you have a error to the MFA
	aws s3api delete-object --bucket resident-evil1 --key newfile.txt   ---- this is for command line 
****note 
resident-evil1 this is my bucket name newfile.txt is my file name 
aws s3api delete-object --bucket resident-evil1 --key newfile.txt --version-id Eqv102ILFiiBJPL2kCWVUBOXPSw
note ********
Eqv102ILFiiBJPL2kCWVUBOXPSw this is my verison id   (now try to delete version id file it required MFA)
>aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket resident-evil1 --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Disabled --mfa "arn:aws:iam::065068297386:mfa/root-account-mfa-device 859871"
		*******note this is disable MFA to the s3 *******
note:- it is very in-secure method because your "access key" & "secreate key" store on locally. 
anyone can access your laptop can access your aws keys.
Versioning must be enabled on bucket.
