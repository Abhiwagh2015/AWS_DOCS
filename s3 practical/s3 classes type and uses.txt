Type of S3 storage classes

S3 Storage Classes can be configured at the object level and a single bucket can contain objects stored across. You can also use S3 Lifecycle policies to automatically
 transition objects between storage classes without any application changes.

1.Amazon S3 Standard (S3 Standard)

S3 Standard offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently accessed data. Because it delivers low latency and high throughput, 
Application: S3 Standard is appropriate for a wide variety of use cases, including cloud applications, dynamic websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications,
 and big data analytics.

2. Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)

S3 Standard-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. S3 Standard-IA offers the high durability, high throughput,
and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval charge. This combination of low cost and high performance make S3 Standard-IA ideal 
for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files.

Key Features:
•	Same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard
•	Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
•	Resilient against events that impact an entire Availability Zone
•	Data is resilient in the event of one entire Availability Zone destruction
•	Designed for 99.9% availability over a given year
•	Backed with the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement for availability
•	Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest
•	S3 Lifecycle management for automatic migration of objects to other S3 Storage Classes


3.Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering)
Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering) is the first cloud storage that automatically reduces your storage costs on a granular object level by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier based on access frequency, without performance impact, retrieval fees, or operational overhead
    
Key Features:
•	Frequent, Infrequent, and Archive Instant Access tiers have the same low-latency and high-throughput performance of S3 Standard
•	The Infrequent Access tier saves up to 40% on storage costs
•	The Archive Instant Access tier saves up to 68% on storage costs
•	Opt-in asynchronous archive capabilities for objects that become rarely accessed
•	Deep Archive Access tier has the same performance as Glacier Deep Archive and saves up to 95% for rarely accessed objects
•	Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones and for 99.9% availability over a given year
•	Backed with the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement for availability
•	Small monthly monitoring and auto tiering charge
•	No operational overhead, no lifecycle charges, no retrieval charges, and no minimum storage duration
•	Objects smaller than 128KB can be stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering but will always be charged at the Frequent Access tier rates, and are not charged the monitoring and automation charge.



3.Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)

S3 One Zone-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Unlike other S3 Storage Classes which store data in a minimum of three 
Availability Zones (AZs), S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single AZ and costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA. S3 One Zone-IA is ideal for customers who want a lower-cost option for
infrequently accessed data but do not require the availability and resilience of S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA. It’s a good choice for storing secondary backup copies of on-premises 
data or easily re-creatable data. You can also use it as cost-effective storage for data that is replicated from another AWS Region using S3 Cross-Region Replication.
S3 One Zone-IA offers the same high durability†, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval charge.

Key Features:
•	Same low latency and high throughput performance of S3 Standard
•	Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects in a single Availability Zone†
•	Designed for 99.5% availability over a given year
•	Backed with the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement for availability
•	Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest
•	S3 Lifecycle management for automatic migration of objects to other S3 Storage Classes
•       Because S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single AWS Availability Zone, data stored in this storage class will be lost in the event of Availability Zone destruction.

4.Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Formerly S3 Glacier)

S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval delivers low-cost storage, up to 10% lower cost (than S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval), for archive data that is accessed 1—2 times per year and 
is retrieved asynchronously. For archive data that does not require immediate access but needs the flexibility to retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as backup or 
disaster recovery use cases, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly S3 Glacier) is the ideal storage class.

Key Features:
•	Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
•	Data is resilient in the event of one entire Availability Zone destruction
•	Supports SSL for data in transit and encryption of data at rest
•	Ideal for backup and disaster recovery use cases when large sets of data occasionally need to be retrieved in minutes, without concern for costs
•	Configurable retrieval times, from minutes to hours, with free bulk retrievals
•	S3 PUT API for direct uploads to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Lifecycle management for automatic migration of objects

5.Archive
The Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes are purpose-built for data archiving, and are designed to provide you with the highest performance, the most retrieval flexibility, and the lowest 
cost archive storage in the cloud. You can choose from three archive storage classes optimized for different access patterns and storage duration.
For archive data that needs immediate access, such as medical images, news media assets, or genomics data, choose the S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class, an archive storage 
class that delivers the lowest cost storage with milliseconds retrieval.
Application: 
For archive data that does not require immediate access but needs the flexibility to retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as backup or disaster recovery use cases, 
choose S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly S3 Glacier), with retrieval in minutes or free bulk retrievals in 5—12 hours.

6.Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive

S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3’s lowest-cost storage class and supports long-term retention and digital preservation for data that may be accessed once or twice in a year. 
It is designed for customers—particularly those in highly-regulated industries, such as financial services, healthcare, and public sectors—that retain data sets for 7—10 years or longer 
to meet regulatory compliance requirements. 
S3 Glacier Deep Archive can also be used for backup and disaster recovery use cases, and is a cost-effective and easy-to-manage alternative to magnetic tape systems, whether they are 
on-premises libraries or off-premises services.

Key Features:
•	Designed for durability of 99.999999999% of objects across multiple Availability Zones
•	Lowest cost storage class designed for long-term retention of data that will be retained for 7-10 years
•	Ideal alternative to magnetic tape libraries
•	Retrieval time within 12 hours
•	S3 PUT API for direct uploads to S3 Glacier Deep Archive, and S3 Lifecycle management for automatic migration of objects
