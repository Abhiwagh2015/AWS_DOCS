Sure, let's create a practical example related to AWS Lambda that involves processing an image uploaded to an S3 bucket. We'll use the Python programming language for this example.

Scenario:
Whenever an image is uploaded to a specific S3 bucket, our Lambda function will trigger, and it will create a thumbnail of the image and store it in another S3 bucket.

Step 1: Set Up S3 Buckets

Create two S3 buckets: one for uploading the original images and another for storing the thumbnails.
Step 2: Create the Lambda Function

Go to the AWS Lambda console.
Click "Create function" and choose "Author from scratch".
Fill in the function details:
Name: ImageThumbnailFunction
Runtime: Python 3.8 (or newer)
Execution role: Choose an existing role with S3 permissions.
Click "Create function".
Step 3: Add Trigger

In the function configuration, scroll down to the "Add triggers" section and click the "Add trigger" button.
Choose "S3" as the trigger type.
Configure the trigger:
Bucket: Select the bucket where original images will be uploaded.
Event type: Choose "All object create events".
Prefix (optional): Leave this empty or specify a folder if needed.
Click "Add" to add the trigger.
Step 4: Write Lambda Function Code

import os
import boto3
from PIL import Image

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        bucket = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
        key = record['s3']['object']['key']
        
        # Download the original image
        local_path = '/tmp/original.jpg'
        s3.download_file(bucket, key, local_path)
        
        # Create a thumbnail
        thumbnail_path = '/tmp/thumbnail.jpg'
        with Image.open(local_path) as img:
            img.thumbnail((100, 100))
            img.save(thumbnail_path)
        
        # Upload the thumbnail to another bucket
        thumbnail_bucket = 'your-thumbnail-bucket-name'
        thumbnail_key = f'thumbnails/{os.path.basename(key)}'
        s3.upload_file(thumbnail_path, thumbnail_bucket, thumbnail_key)
        
        # Clean up
        os.remove(local_path)
        os.remove(thumbnail_path)

Replace 'your-thumbnail-bucket-name' with the actual name of your thumbnail bucket.

Step 5: Deploy and Test

Save the Lambda function code.
Upload an image to the S3 bucket specified in the trigger.
Monitor the Lambda function in the AWS Lambda console to see the logs and any errors.
This example demonstrates how to create a Lambda function that automatically generates thumbnails for uploaded images using the Pillow library for image manipulation and the Boto3 library for interacting with AWS services. It shows how Lambda functions can be used to process files in response to events, like new object uploads to an S3 bucket.
