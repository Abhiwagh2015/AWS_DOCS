***********************************************************************************************

A network load balancer (NLB) and an application load balancer (ALB) are both types of load balancers used in cloud computing. They distribute incoming network 
traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization, minimize response time, and improve overall application performance. However, there are 
some key differences between the two.


1. Layer:

   - Network Load Balancer (NLB): It operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model. It balances the load based on the IP address and port number.

   - Application Load Balancer (ALB): It operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model. It balances the load based on the content of the request, 
     such as the URL or the HTTP headers.


2. Target Type:

   - Network Load Balancer (NLB): It supports both instances and IP addresses as targets.

   - Application Load Balancer (ALB): It supports only instances as targets.


3. Protocols:

   - Network Load Balancer (NLB): It supports TCP and UDP protocols.

   - Application Load Balancer (ALB): It supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols.


4. SSL/TLS Termination:

   - Network Load Balancer (NLB): It does not support SSL/TLS termination. (Secure Sockets Layer, Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA))

   - Application Load Balancer (ALB): It supports SSL/TLS termination, which means it can handle the encryption and decryption of data at the load balancer level, 
     reducing the load on the backend servers.


5. Pricing:

   - Network Load Balancer (NLB): It is generally more expensive than an Application Load Balancer due to its higher processing power and capacity.

   - Application Load Balancer (ALB): It is generally more cost-effective for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.


In summary, the choice between a network load balancer and an application load balancer depends on the specific requirements of your application. If you need to balance 
 traffic based on the content of the request or require SSL/TLS termination, an application load balancer is the better choice. On the other hand, if you need to balance 
traffic based on IP addresses and ports, and do not require SSL/TLS termination, a network load balancer is more suitable.
