practical:- 

cloudWatch Three stages
1.In alarm
2.Insufficient data 
3.OK

Moto: 

step1:-create VPC
         Click on "vpc"
            select "flow logs"
            click "create flow logs"
            type name of flogs Ex. "my-vpc-flow-logs"
            Destination choose "Send to CloudWatch Logs"
            type Destination log group name Ex. "my-vpc-log-group"
            IAM role "admin-access"
            click "create flow log"

step2:- create 2 EC2-instances
        1st-instane name: 1st-instance
                        create security-group: my-SG
                        ports: ssh-http-ICMP-IPv-4
        2nd-instance name: cpu-utilization
                        create security-group: my-SG
                        ports: ssh-http-ICMP-IPv-4

step3: 1.connect for 1st instance
       sudo -i
       ping <public-ip> -l 4096
           connect to the internet...
       #return in instance click instance-id 
            click "Monitoring"
            check cpu-utilization

       2.connect for 2st instance
       sudo -i
       sudo yum install stress -y
       stress
       stress --cpu 90 --io 4 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 10m
       w or uptime :- command through check the cpu utilization
       top   (show jump chatrus created for increase cpu utilization)
       #return in instance click instance-id 
            click "Monitoring"
            check cpu-utilization   :-(automatically increase cpu-utilization)

step4:search "CloudWatch" service
      1.click "Dashboards"
          click "Create dashboard"
          type Dashboard name  Ex. "my-dashboard" click "create dashboard"

      2.click "add a first widget"        
           select any widget type "but select line" click "next" select "Matrix"  click "Next"
      3.In Matrics select "region you create instance"
           Click on "EC2" click "Per-Instance Metrics"
           Copy "cpu-utilization instance id" & paste it "in search tab"
           Choose matrix Ex. "cpu-utilization" click "Create widget"
           Click Custom and choose "Local time zone"
       4.Suppose you have add new matrix Ex. "Network-In" follow same process
       
step5:share dashboard on internet link steps:
       1.click on Action
          click "start sharing"
          type "Share"
          click on "Confirm and previous policy"
         click "Accept policy and generate shareable link"
         copy link and paste on Google tab show your matrix 

step6:Return to dashboard and delete dashboard

Note :This is practical for cpu utilization how to show in cloudwatch
Next practical is after increase CPU utilization instance is automatically stop
