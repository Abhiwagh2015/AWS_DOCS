step 1. create EC2-instances

step 2. Create increase CPU-utilization command for instance
        sudo -i
        sha1sum /dev/zero &    :type for increase cpu utilization (min 4 time enter command)
        top   (show jump chatrus created for increase cpu utilization)
 
        Stop CPU-utilization command for instance
        top
        ps -a
        kill all pid 2224 2225 2226    #multiple sha1sum pid
        ps -a                          # show to delete sha1sum pid

step3. create alarm steps
       select instance click on "Actions"
       select "Monitor and troubleshoot"
       select "Manage Cloudwatch alarms" 

       Choose "Create an alarm"
       Alarm action select "Stop"    #means trigger to greater than CPU-utilization 70% after stop the instance
       percent "70"
       Type alarm name Ex. "action-stop-alarm"
       show "sample matrix data at 70%" and create

OR

step3. Search simple Notification Service "SNS" Service
       click "create topic"
       select type "Standard"
       type Topic name Ex. "my-topic"
       Display name Ex. "my-Training" click "create topic"
       click "Create Subscription"
       protocol select "Email"
       Endpoint type your email "sagar.sonule001@gmail.com"  click "Create Subscription"
       GoTo email account and click "confirm subscription" 
      
      click your topic 
      click publish massage
      Subject "Sample Notification"
      Massage Body in Type any type of massage #massage show your notification on mail
            

step4. Goto "CloudWatch" service
       click on "In alarm"
       click "create alarm" next "select matrix" 
       In matrix click "EC2"
       select "Per-Instance Metrics"
       Copy "cpu-utilization instance id" & paste it "in search tab"
       Choose matrix Ex. "cpu-utilization" click select matrix
    
       choose peried 5-minute
       select Threshold type "static"
       cpu-Utilization select "Greater/Equal" than "60%"  Next
       Choose "In alarm" 
       select an existing SNS topic
       select you created existing topic Ex. "my-topic"
       Ec2 action in Click "stop this instance" next
       type Alarm name ex."notification alarm" next $ create alarm

practical :-
   suppose, your cpu-utilization in 70% sent notification on your email and stop the ec2-Instance
